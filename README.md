This is the Python implementation of Stefan DÃ¼rr and Matthias Sparr.

No function that was used reduces OpenCL coding complexity.
The code has been commented for better understanding.

In the project directory, the input image can be found. Moreover, a lot of output images with different values assigned to "radius" and "sigma" are in there, where the results can be checked. 

It works on any machine that has python installed, after following this step:

1. Install the libraries with pip (Python Package Manager)
Enter the following commands in the terminal:

pip install numpy
pip install PIL
pip install pyopencl

2. You're all done!
